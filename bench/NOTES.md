# Benchmark notes and competitor differences

## How to run

See `bench/PLAN.md`. The exact nginx.conf for a published run is stored in that
run’s result directory and at `bench/nginx.conf` (rendered from `bench/nginx.conf.in`).

## dusty-tuned (HttpArena HTTP/1.1 leader)

Source: HttpArena `frameworks/dusty-tuned` at commit
`5646c1d2a4f4656073430ce55ed39a5c9c2e6749`, upstream [dusty](https://github.com/lalinsky/dusty)
on the zio runtime, built `zig build --release=fast`. “tuned” means json.zig and
no request or keep-alive timeouts.

It is **not** an nginx-compatible server. The bench runs it with an equivalent
setup, not `nginx.conf`.

| Topic | zhttpd / nginx | dusty-tuned in this bench |
|---|---|---|
| Config | shared `bench/nginx.conf` | no config file; routes hard-coded |
| Bind | from `listen` (48080 / 48443) | `PORT` / `TLS_PORT` env (our patch) |
| Static files | `root bench/www` + `try_files` | `STATIC_DIR` mounted at `/static` (our patch); also advertises precompressed `.br`/`.gzip` variants |
| TLS certs | `ssl_certificate` / `ssl_certificate_key` | `TLS_CERT` / `TLS_KEY` (already in upstream) |
| TLS settings | `ssl_protocols TLSv1.3`, session cache + tickets from the same directives | dusty’s own TLS stack, ALPN `http/1.1` only; no nginx `ssl_session_cache` |
| HTTP/2 | `http2 off` (zhttpd ignores the directive: not implemented) | ALPN does not offer `h2` |
| Processes | `worker_processes auto` (16 on this Mac), `reuseport` | one process, zio executors `.auto` |
| Timeouts | `keepalive_timeout 65` | none (the “tuned” variant) |
| Dynamic `/baseline11` | nginx `return 200 "3"` (zhttpd implements `return`) | dusty handler (same body) |

Build wrapper: `bench/competitors/build-dusty.sh`. The patch is
`bench/competitors/dusty-tuned.patch` and only adds the three environment
overrides; defaults stay 8080/8081 and `/data/static`.

### Known pitfalls

- macOS has ~16k ephemeral ports and a 30 s TIME_WAIT. A keep-alive-off run
  that is time-bounded will burn the pool and fail with
  `Can't assign requested address (os error 49)`. The harness therefore uses a
  fixed request count and waits for TIME_WAIT to drain.
- The first published `--quick` run (20261110-100440) still hit this on dusty
  HTTPS (and partly on HTTP noka) because dusty ran last, after earlier noka
  samples. Later runs wait harder between samples.
- dusty logged `error.SocketUnconnected` on some connections during that run.
- Run `20261110-100920` is invalid (leftover zhttpd held the ports). Ignore it.

## io_uring

Not used. nginx 1.30.6 has no io_uring support; zhttpd has no io_uring backend.
Linux comparisons use epoll + `reuseport`.

## Apache

Deferred (“Apache later”). No Apache binary or scenario is wired up.
